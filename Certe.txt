If you're on the Basic Managed WordPress Hosting plan, it doesn't come with a traditional cPanel or direct FTP access in the same way that other hosting plans like Web Hosting with cPanel do. However, you can still manage your files through the built-in File Manager in your GoDaddy WordPress Dashboard, or use SFTP for a more direct file access.

Would you like instructions on how to use SFTP for your site?
